# This code first defines a function called logistic_map(), which takes a current value of the map x and a parameter r as input and returns the next value of the map. The logistic map is a simple mathematical model that can be used to generate chaotic behavior.

#The logistic_map() function works by multiplying the current value of the map x by r and then subtracting x. This is repeated over and over again, and the results are plotted to create a graph.

#The main() function then calls the logistic_map() function on a few different values of r. The results of the logistic_map() function are then printed to the console.

#To run this code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as logistic_map.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:

#python logistic_map.py
#This will print the results of the logistic map for a few different values of r to the console.

#This is just a simple example of how Python can be used to implement chaos theory. There are many other ways to implement chaos theory in Python, and there are many other chaotic systems that can be studied using Python.
