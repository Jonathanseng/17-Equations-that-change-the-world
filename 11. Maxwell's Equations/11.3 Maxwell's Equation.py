# This code solves Maxwell's equations in 3D using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The FDTD method is a numerical method for solving partial differential equations in time and space. It is a very powerful method for solving Maxwell's equations, and it is used in a wide variety of applications, such as electromagnetic simulation, antenna design, and microwave engineering.

#The code above first initializes the electric and magnetic fields to zero. Then, it solves Maxwell's equations for 10 time steps. At each time step, the electric field is updated using Faraday's law, and the magnetic field is updated using Ampere's law. The code then prints the electric and magnetic fields.

#To run the code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as maxwell.py, you can run it by typing the following command into the command line:
