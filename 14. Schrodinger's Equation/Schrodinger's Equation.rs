// This code is similar to the Python code, but it is written in Rust. The main difference is that the Rust code uses the f64 type for floating-point numbers, while the Python code uses the float type.

//The Rust code also uses the println!() macro to print the wave function to the console. The println!() macro is a convenient way to print formatted text to the console in Rust.

//This code is a simple example of how the Schr√∂dinger equation can be solved in Rust. More complex examples can be found online or in textbooks on quantum mechanics.
