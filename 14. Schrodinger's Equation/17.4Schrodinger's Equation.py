# This code defines a function called schrodinger_equation() that solves the Schrödinger equation for a particle in a three-dimensional potential. The function takes the particle's position, mass, energy, and potential energy as input, and returns the wave function of the particle.

#The main function of the code defines the values of the particle's position, mass, energy, and potential energy, and then calls the schrodinger_equation() function to calculate the wave function. The wave function is then printed to the console.

#This code is a simple example of how the Schrödinger equation can be solved in Python. More complex examples can be found online or in textbooks on quantum mechanics.
