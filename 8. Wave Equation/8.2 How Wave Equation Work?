The wave equation works by describing how the displacement of a medium changes over time and space. The equation is a second-order partial differential equation, which means that it involves second-order partial derivatives of the wave function. This means that the wave equation can describe how the wave function changes in both time and space.

The wave equation can be derived from the principle of conservation of energy. The principle of conservation of energy states that the total energy of a system must remain constant. In the case of waves, the total energy of the wave is the sum of the kinetic energy of the wave and the potential energy of the wave.

The kinetic energy of the wave is related to the velocity of the wave. The velocity of the wave is the rate at which the wave function changes in space. The potential energy of the wave is related to the displacement of the wave function. The displacement of the wave function is the distance that the medium has been displaced from its equilibrium position.

The wave equation can also be derived from the equations of motion for a medium. The equations of motion for a medium describe how the force on a particle in the medium changes over time. The wave equation can be derived from these equations by assuming that the force on the particle is proportional to the displacement of the particle.

The wave equation has many solutions, which represent different types of waves. Some of the most common types of waves that are described by the wave equation include:

* **Transverse waves:** These waves propagate perpendicular to the direction of the wave motion. Examples of transverse waves include water waves and seismic S waves.
* **Longitudinal waves:** These waves propagate parallel to the direction of the wave motion. Examples of longitudinal waves include sound waves and seismic P waves.
* **Surface waves:** These waves propagate along the interface between two media. Examples of surface waves include ocean waves and seismic Rayleigh waves.

The wave equation is a powerful tool for understanding the propagation of waves. It can be used to predict the behavior of waves in different media, and it can be used to design devices that interact with waves.
