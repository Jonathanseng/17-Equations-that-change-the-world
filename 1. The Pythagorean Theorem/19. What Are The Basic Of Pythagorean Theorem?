The Pythagorean Theorem is a mathematical formula that relates the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. The theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side of the triangle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This can be written mathematically as a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are the lengths of the legs of the triangle and c is the length of the hypotenuse.

The basic of the Pythagorean Theorem are as follows:

* A right triangle is a triangle that has one right angle (90 degrees).
* The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle. It is opposite the right angle.
* The legs of a right triangle are the other two sides of the triangle. They are opposite the acute angles.
* The Pythagorean Theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the legs.

The Pythagorean Theorem can be used to solve a variety of problems involving right triangles. For example, it can be used to find the length of a side of a triangle if the lengths of the other two sides are known. It can also be used to find the area of a triangle.

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in mathematics and is used in a wide variety of applications, including surveying, construction, and navigation. It is also used in many other areas of mathematics, such as trigonometry and calculus.
