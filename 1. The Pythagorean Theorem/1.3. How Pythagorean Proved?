The Pythagorean theorem can be proved in a variety of ways. Here is one geometric proof:

1. Draw a right triangle with legs of length a and b and hypotenuse of length c.
2. Draw a square with side length a + b.
3. Divide the square into four right triangles, each with legs of length a and b.
4. The four right triangles together form the original right triangle.
5. The area of the square is (a + b)^2.
6. The area of each of the four right triangles is (1/2)ab.
7. The total area of the four right triangles is 2ab.
8. Therefore, the area of the square is equal to the total area of the four right triangles.
9. This means that (a + b)^2 = 2ab.
10. Expanding (a + b)^2 gives a^2 + 2ab + b^2.
11. Subtracting 2ab from both sides gives a^2 + b^2 = c^2.

This proves that the Pythagorean theorem is true.

Here is an algebraic proof:

1. Let a and b be the lengths of the legs of a right triangle and c be the length of the hypotenuse.
2. We can square both sides of the equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2 to get a^4 + 2ab^2 + b^4 = c^4.
3. We can then factor the left-hand side of the equation to get (a^2 + b^2)^2 = c^4.
4. Since (a^2 + b^2)^2 is always positive, c^4 must also be positive.
5. Therefore, c^2 must be equal to a^2 + b^2.

This proves that the Pythagorean theorem is true.

Here is a numerical proof:

1. Choose any three positive integers, a, b, and c, such that a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
2. Construct a right triangle with legs of length a and b and hypotenuse of length c.
3. Measure the lengths of the sides of the triangle using a ruler or other measuring device.
4. You will find that the measurements of the sides of the triangle are consistent with the Pythagorean theorem.

This proves that the Pythagorean theorem is true for at least one set of values of a, b, and c. Since the Pythagorean theorem is a mathematical equation, it must be true for all sets of values of a, b, and c.
