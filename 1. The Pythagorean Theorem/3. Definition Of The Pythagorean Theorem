The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry between the three sides of a right triangle. It states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

In algebraic terms, the theorem can be written as follows:

```
a² + b² = c²
```

where a and b are the lengths of the legs of the triangle and c is the length of the hypotenuse.

The theorem can be proved using a variety of methods, including the following:

* Using the area of a square
* Using the distance formula
* Using the law of cosines

The Pythagorean Theorem has been known for centuries and has been used in a wide variety of applications, including surveying, construction, and navigation. It is one of the most important and fundamental theorems in mathematics.
