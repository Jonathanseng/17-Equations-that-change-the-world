The Pythagorean Theorem works by using the area of a square to represent the length of a side of a right triangle. The square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This means that if you know the lengths of the other two sides, you can find the length of the hypotenuse by squaring each side and adding them together, then taking the square root of the result.

For example, if the lengths of the legs of a right triangle are 3 and 4, then the area of the square with side length 3 is 9, and the area of the square with side length 4 is 16. The sum of these areas is 25, which is the square of the hypotenuse. Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse is 5.

The Pythagorean Theorem can be used to find the length of any side of a right triangle, as long as the lengths of the other two sides are known. It is one of the most important and fundamental theorems in mathematics, and it has been used in a wide variety of applications, including surveying, construction, and navigation.

Here are some examples of how the Pythagorean Theorem can be used:

* A surveyor can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance between two points on a map.
* A construction worker can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of a beam that needs to be cut to support a roof.
* A navigator can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance between two ships at sea.

The Pythagorean Theorem is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. It is a fundamental part of mathematics, and it has been used for centuries to solve practical problems.
